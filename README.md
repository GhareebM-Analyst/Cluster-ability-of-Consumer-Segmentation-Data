# Cluster-ability-of-Consumer-Segmentation-Data

In this project, cluster-ability of Consumer Segmentation Data was tested using original data and data subjected to dimensionality  reduction using Principal component analysis (PCA). The complete data processing  and modeling can be viewed [here]( https://github.com/GhareebM-Analyst/Cluster-ability-of-Consumer-Segmentation-Data/blob/main/Final%20model_PCA%20.ipynb)
